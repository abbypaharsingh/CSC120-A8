Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represents a child that live in a magical reality. This child is able to do basic human actvities like grabbing, dropping, using etc. Some things like flying and walking and casting spells come with age, and the program is coded to tell whether the child is of the appropriate age or not.  
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I implemented the spellcast method which allows the child to cast a spell, because it seemed to complete the magical theme.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I initially forgot to declare the variables before the constructor because I was still in the python mindset. I would advise someone taking this course in the future to keep practicing java in order to get used to its differences.
